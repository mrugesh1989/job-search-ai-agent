As a career strategist specializing in software engineering, I've analyzed your profile focusing on your 2-5 years of experience, core skills in Python, JavaScript, and React, alongside your interest in Node.js, AWS, and Docker, and your salary expectations. While I was unable to retrieve specific job postings due to current technical limitations with the job search tools, I can provide a strategic overview based on prevailing market trends and common requirements for intermediate Software Engineers.

Given your existing skill set, the best matching roles would typically be **Full-stack Software Engineer**, **Backend Engineer (Python-focused)**, or **Frontend Engineer (React Specialist)**. A Full-stack role is an excellent fit, leveraging both your Python (for backend logic, APIs) and JavaScript/React (for dynamic user interfaces) skills, making you a versatile contributor. Backend Engineer roles would capitalize on your Python proficiency for building robust services, data processing, and API development. Frontend Engineer roles would allow you to deeply specialize in React, building complex UIs and optimizing user experiences. These roles are foundational for intermediate professionals and provide ample opportunity to deepen technical expertise.

Analyzing your required vs. preferred skills, Python, JavaScript, and React are critical and highly sought-after. These form the bedrock of modern web application development and will open many doors. Your preferred skills—Node.js, AWS, and Docker—are exceptionally well-chosen for career advancement and hitting your desired salary range. Node.js complements your JavaScript skills, enabling you to work across the full stack with a single language and expand into backend services. AWS proficiency is a game-changer, essential for understanding cloud-native development, deployment, scalability, and infrastructure, moving you towards architecturally significant roles. Docker is crucial for modern development workflows, containerization, and DevOps practices, ensuring your code runs consistently across environments. Developing these preferred skills will transition you from a feature implementer to someone who can design, build, and deploy entire systems.

Achieving a salary range of $150,000 - $200,000 as an intermediate Software Engineer with 2-5 years of experience is ambitious but definitely attainable, particularly in competitive markets or at companies valuing deep technical contributions and cloud expertise. To reach this, you must not only demonstrate strong coding abilities but also problem-solving acumen, an understanding of system design, and the ability to take ownership of features or even small projects. Career progression towards technical leadership or advanced software engineering roles hinges on expanding your influence beyond just writing code. This involves contributing to architectural discussions, mentoring junior engineers, improving development processes, and demonstrating a holistic understanding of software lifecycles. The preferred skills are key enablers for this growth, allowing you to contribute at a higher, more strategic level.

To address skill gaps and align with market trends, prioritize hands-on experience with Node.js, AWS, and Docker. For Node.js, build a full-stack application leveraging your React frontend and a Node.js backend. For AWS, consider pursuing an AWS Certified Developer - Associate or Solutions Architect - Associate certification, focusing on services like EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, and API Gateway. Implement Docker in your personal projects and advocate for its use in your current team's development workflow. Beyond specific tools, focus on developing a strong understanding of system design principles, microservices architecture, data modeling, security best practices, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). The market increasingly values engineers who are "T-shaped" (deep in one area, broad across many), can work full-stack, understand cloud infrastructure, and contribute to DevOps initiatives. Continuous learning and practical application of these skills will be paramount for your continued growth and leadership aspirations.
