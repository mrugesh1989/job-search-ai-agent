I encountered an API error with the quick_search tool, and previous attempts with salary_job_search and job_search (even with broader terms) yielded no results for the specified criteria (Software Engineer, 2-5 years experience, $150,000 - $200,000 salary, Python, JavaScript, React, in NJ, USA). Due to these technical limitations and the lack of successful job search results, I am unable to provide the requested 5-10 job postings with comprehensive details.
